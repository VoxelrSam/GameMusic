				<h1 class=header>The Project</h1>
				
				<div class=text>
					
					<p>
						The project as whole started simple; I wanted to understand the impact that video games had on people in general. As I began work on this project, a specific question popped in my head that intrigued me. 
					</p>
					
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<h1 class=subheader><em>Why is video game music so memorable?</em></h1>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						My goal suddenly shifted to answer this question that brewed in my head. Video game music always meant so much to me and brought back so many memories, and I knew that I was not alone in this. I could list off specific songs that were integral to my gaming experiences as a child, but I could not place why they were so special to me. Of course hearing an old song from my past would bring back some nostalgia, but I always felt that the reason these were so special consisted of more than just the fact that these were old songs. Through my research, I intended to answer this intriguing question as best as I could.
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						I believe that it is important that we study and take a look at video games in depth. I believe that they really are a huge innovation in the realm of art. William Gibbons says, "In recent years the idea that video games are worth studying both as an important aspect of popular culture and as independent works of art has gained a certain amount of credence in academic circles. With such acceptance, scholars have begun to examine the elements that constitute a game, including the importance of music in the gameplaying experience."
					</p>
					<br/>
				
				</div>
				
				<h1 class=header>Interviewees</h1>
				
				<div class=text>
					<p>
						People, for all intents and purposes, are what this project hinges on. To have fully understood my topic, I needed to interview various gamers so that I could draw accurate conclusions about what they felt. It is one thing to just read what a book says about a group of people such as this, but it is important to get that hands on experience that will not only back up what a book might say, but will also give new and more personalised information.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br/>
				
				<h1 class=subheader>r/gamemusic</h1>
				
				<div class=subtext>
					<p>
						I wanted to be able to get a wide sample of answers and data from people who loved both music and games, so I turned to the gamemusic subreddit on a website called Reddit. For all intents and purposes, it is pretty much just a forum for people who love the music in video games. I was overwhelmed by the amount of support and answers people gave. Many people were quick to list off their favorite games, the songs from those games, and why those songs were special to them. I was glad to have gotten such a diverse and extensive response so that I could weigh everyone’s opinions against each other to find patterns and to come to conclusions.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<h1 class=subheader>Ace Waters</h1>
				
				<div class=subtext>
					<p>
						To get a full understanding for my topic, I needed to not only get input from gamers, but also from someone who was actively involved with game music in some way. I had emailed a number of composers and cover artists, and Ace Waters was kind enough to respond and give rather detailed answers!
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						Ace covers pieces from video games using a mixture of synthesised and acoustic instruments. His most famous videos consist of covers from the game Undertale, but he covers a wide variety of both old and new game music that he deems special. When asked why he start making video game covers in the first place, he said, “I was doing covers part time while gigging and working a job, and I decided to cover a song from the Donkey Kong Country series because it’s some of my favorite game music ever. People really liked it and I really liked doing it, so I kept going with it and eventually shifted my focus to doing game covers full time.” Because of his love for video game music, he was able to grow a sizable audience on Youtube and collaborate with many different talented musicians.

				<h1 class=header>Nostalgia</h1>
				
				<div class=text>
				
				<p>
					Many gamers feel a very deep connection to games and their music beyond the fact that they may just enjoy the sound of said music. Game music extends beyond the games and lives on through many diehard fans who love to listen to and even cover songs from their favorite games. A portion of the book <em>Game Sound</em> describes Karen Collins’ experience in listening to an orchestra cover classic game music. She writes,
				</p>
				<br/>
				
				<p class=quote>
					The power of video game music to attract such an enthusiastic crowd— many of whom dressed up in costumes for the occasion— was in many ways remarkable. After all, symphony orchestras have for years been struggling to survive financially amid dwindling attendance and increasing costs. <em>Video Games Live</em>, along with <em>Play!</em> and other symphonic performances of game music, however, have been bringing the orchestra to younger people, and bringing game music to their parents.
				</p>
				<br/>
				
				<p>
					It is no secret that video game music is impactful, but why? There are many factors that can affect it, but it really comes down to two big reasons.
				</p>
				
				<br/>
					
					<h1 class=subheader>The Experience</h1>
					<br/>
				
					<p>
						The biggest factor that plays into the nostalgia behind game music is that playing a game is an active experience. Because of this, players become deeply rooted in the stories and events happening in the game. A video game is not a type of media that is consumed passively by someone just observing it, but it is something that requires intervention and interaction from a player. This in a sense turns the game into the player’s experience rather than an experience that the main character of a movie is going through. Because of this very personal connection with the game, when a player hears a song, he is not just reminiscing about that song. He remembers very specific moments and details about the world and everything that happened in the game. He remembers not just a piece of music, but rather he is remembering what it was like to be in that game world and to interact with it. Winifred Phillips summarizes this idea perfectly in her book <em>A Composer's Guide to Game Music</em>. She writes,
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p class=quote>
						We know that a musical theme expressed within the body of a video game is experienced differently than themes in passive forms of entertainment, like television and film. In a game, a musical theme accompanies an activity that the players of the game are performing. The music has essentially become the soundtrack to the personal adventures of the players. When the music swells at a pivotal moment and a recognizable melody begins, the players hear that melody just as they are engaging in an activity they enjoy. This interactive engagement alters the way in which the music is heard and remembered. According to an article for Topics in Cognitive Science written by Michelene Chi (2008), psychology professor at Arizona State University, our ability to retain experiences, process information, and successfully learn new things is directly impacted by how engaged we are at the time—therefore, interactive experiences are better than passive ones.
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						This idea of experiences being tied to these songs lined up with answers that I had received on Reddit. One user by the name of otah007 exemplified this idea when he said, “When I listen to MEGALOVANIA I remember how it felt to fight Sans, when I listen to The Streets of Whiterun I feel just like I do when walking around Skyrim's cities - safe, calm and in awe [sic].” For him and many others, very specific memories are tied to these songs. Whenever I myself hear one of Skyrim’s pieces again, it reminds me of that original sense of wonder and curiosity that I had when playing through the game for the first time.
					</p>
					<br/>
				
					<p>
						For music to have this effect to its fullest extent, it must also fit with what the player is doing in the game at any particular moment. With video games being an active experience, players can interact with the game in whichever way they please. A game composer must then compose in a way in which the music is either ready to change at any moment  or it just stays at one similar dynamic level the whole time as to provide ambience. In his book <em>Writing Interactive Music for Video Games</em>, Michael Sweet writes, “This active interaction between the game and the player also affects how the music must change and react to player decisions. The music must be written in such a way that it is adaptable based on the player interaction.” It is important for game music to never feel out of place no matter what the player may be doing.
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<br/>
					
					<h1 class=subheader>Simplicity</h1>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						Game music had its origin on machines with incredibly limited hardware compared to what we have today. Because of this, composers could only use a small number of notes at one time. This forced them to put even more effort into the melodies to make sure that they sounded good. A song that consists of a really strong melody and not much else makes it easy to remember and certainly easy to hum. When Ace Waters was asked about the difference between game music and other music he said,
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p class=quote>
						Well, in the beginnings of musical composition, limitation was the name of the game. Limited channels, sound choices, and time length all deeply shaped the craft of video game composition during its infancy. A lot of that you see true today, even as those limitations are lifted. This is also, in part, the reason why more modern triple A games with symphonic, movie style, soundtracks seem somewhat out of place in the game world or at the very least they are not terribly memorable. On the other hand, artists like Disasterpeace are crafting long form, ambient soundscapes for games that are some of the best game music for our time. So, honestly, although gaming music's roots gave it a very distinct sound from limitation, the further we move forward, the more you find game music is not so separated from "normal music."
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						Reddit user Michael from the cover band Extra Lives also spoke to me on this point when he said,
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p class=quote>
						It's said that "necessity is the mother of invention"--old-school video game composers were presented with a limited sonic palette, a fixed limited on the amount of simultaneous instrumental voices, a restrictive budget and the need for that music to be strophic and loopable. Composers responded to this unique conundrum by creating uber-memorable, emotionally effective (and affective) pieces that were inherently succinct [sic].
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						The limitations put on older game music actually ended up benefitting them in an unforeseen way in that the composers were forced to create memorable melodies. Pieces that sound more like modern film soundtracks are less memorable due to their lack of strong melody line, but they still serve to elicit emotion in the player. In the end, simplicity turns out to make game music much more memorable. The video linked below goes into more depth on the topic of simplicity in video games.

				<h1 class=header>A Couple of Player Favorites</h1>
				<br/>
				<br/>
			
				<h1 class=subheader>Undertale</h1>
				
				<div class=text>
				
					<p>
						Undertale is a masterpiece of a game in many aspects, but one of the main reasons why is because of the uniqueness of the music in it. Undertale became a phenomenon that swept across the gaming world shortly after it came out. The characters and the story really struck players, and behind all that was a masterful soundtrack. Undertale’s soundtrack spans across many different genres of music all while still holding true to the fundamentals of game music. Reddit user otah007 explained to me how some of the songs were used by saying,
					</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p class=quote>
						Each boss theme reflects not only the character, but also the fight itself - for example, Muffet's fight (Spider Dance) is very frantic, whereas Asgore's fight (ASGORE) is more focused on the character…. Toby Fox is not only a self-taught musician, he also composed a total of 101 tracks for this game, and many of them are similar to each other in subtle (or not-so-subtle) ways, creating sub-conscious links between characters and events. For example, Heartache and ASGORE are very similar in parts, because Asgore and Toriel were once King and Queen.

				<h1 class=subheader>Fez</h1>
				
				<div class=text>
				
					<p>
						Fez easily contains one of the greatest soundtracks in a game made by an independant developer. The songs in Fez help paint the environment and even serve a functional purpose with the gameplay in one instance. Fez’s soundtrack was written by Rich Vreeland, also known as Disasterpiece. In the soundtrack Rich often uses a combination of a drawn out rubato music style mixed with retro chiptune sounds to build unique and memorable ambiances to the varying areas in the game. In the example linked below, the song is not just used as a way to describe the environment, but it is also used as a functional part of playing the game. Platforms appear and disappear in time with the music to tell the player when he should jump. Most of Rich’s music in the game is written to tell a story or convey an idea, but this case is a good example of using music to explicitly give the player cues on how to play the game. The intricacies of the Fez soundtrack are quite impressive when looked at in detail.
